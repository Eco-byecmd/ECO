  <h3 id="profile">üë§ My Profile</h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Eco C. Gayapa</strong>.  
  I am an ICT student at TCU. My name is Eco C. Gayapa, and I would describe myself as someone who enjoys excitement and creativity, which is why I love watching action movies. They keep me entertained with their intense fight scenes, powerful stories, and heroic characters. Among all the studios, I am a huge fan of Marvel because their movies combine action, humor, and deep storylines that keep me inspired. I admire how Marvel heroes face challenges with courage and teamwork, and I find myself learning lessons about strength and resilience from them. At the same time, I also value inclusivity and acceptance in my life, which is why I hold a special love and respect for Black gay people. I believe their love and existence are powerful because they show courage and authenticity in a world that sometimes misunderstands them. Their happiness and strength inspire me to appreciate the importance of equality and love without boundaries. Supporting them is my way of saying that no one should be judged for who they are or who they love. This belief makes me proud of the values I stand for as a person. Overall, I am Eco C. Gayapa, a fan of action, a lover of Marvel, and someone who respects and celebrates love in all its forms. Beyond my love for action movies and Marvel, I also consider myself a person who values creativity in many forms. I enjoy exploring stories that inspire me, whether through films, books, or even conversations with people who have different perspectives. These stories remind me that life is full of lessons waiting to be learned, and I believe every person has something valuable to teach. My admiration for Marvel heroes goes hand in hand with my belief that real-life heroes also exist, and they are often the people who simply choose to live authentically. This is why I look up to Black gay people, because their courage in showing love despite discrimination is nothing less than heroic. I find strength in the way they carry themselves with pride, and it motivates me to stand firm in my own beliefs. Supporting them is not just about admiration but also about standing up for fairness, because I cannot accept a world where people are treated unequally for being themselves. I know that my voice may be small, but I believe that even small voices can make a difference when they come from a place of sincerity. For this reason, I choose to speak with respect and appreciation whenever I talk about diversity and acceptance. I believe that love in all its forms should be celebrated because it connects us as human beings. Whether through movies or real life, the message that resonates with me is that love always wins in the end. I see my passion for Marvel and my respect for gay Black people as connected, because both teach me the importance of resilience, strength, and the power of being true to oneself. These values guide me in how I treat others and how I want to live my own life. As Eco C. Gayapa, I am not just a fan of heroes on the screen‚ÄîI am also someone who wants to honor the everyday heroes around me who show love and courage despite the challenges they face. </p>

  My favorite quote is: Aside from food and entertainment, I also value people and relationships. My favorite kind of people are those who are kind, respectful, and open-minded. I admire Black gay people in particular because their courage and authenticity inspire me to be strong as well.

School subjects also count as favorites for me, especially those that challenge my mind and allow me to express myself. I enjoy subjects that involve reading and discussion, because they give me a chance to share my thoughts and learn from others. Technology is another favorite of mine, since it connects me to movies, music, and friends. Social media and online platforms help me express myself and discover new things I never would have known otherwise. My favorite times of day are the evenings, when I can finally rest and enjoy the things I love most without rushing. I also love weekends because they give me time to recharge and focus on hobbies. Being around supportive friends and family is another favorite part of my life, because they give me strength and happiness.

Overall, my favorites represent who I am as a person. They show that I enjoy excitement through action movies, inspiration through Marvel, joy through food and music, and courage through the people I admire. They remind me that life is not only about big achievements but also about small, meaningful moments that make each day brighter. Most of all, my favorites reflect my values: love, respect, and authenticity. I am proud to share them, because they reveal the kind of person I am becoming. And as Eco C.
